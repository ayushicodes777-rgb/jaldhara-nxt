## 📱 Project Overview

JalDhara (meaning "Water Flow" in Hindi) is an AI-powered agricultural water management assistant designed to help farmers optimize their water usage and adopt sustainable farming practices. Our solution bridges the knowledge gap for farmers by providing personalized recommendations based on their specific crop, soil, and climate conditions.

### 🌱 Problem Statement
**AI-Powered Water Footprint Calculator for Sustainable Agriculture**

Indian agriculture faces a severe water crisis, with inefficient irrigation practices leading to water wastage and diminishing groundwater levels. Most farmers lack access to scientific tools and knowledge for optimizing water usage, resulting in:
- Over-irrigation in some areas
- Inefficient water distribution
- Lack of awareness about water-efficient alternatives
- Difficulty in adopting sustainable practices
